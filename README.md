# PROJECT DESCRIPTION:

This Task-4 project involves the development of a basic yet functional e-learning platform user interface named “SkillBoost Academy”. The purpose of this website is to allow users to explore technology-related courses, learn through embedded video content and track their learning progress visually.

The platform is created using HTML, CSS and JavaScript, focusing on clean code structure, proper alignment, visual hierarchy and responsive layout. Each page is connected using a navigation bar, which makes switching between pages easy. A footer is added to maintain a complete and professional appearance for every page.

The main intention behind the project is to practice and apply front-end development skills by designing a beginner-friendly educational platform with interactive features.

# OBJECTIVES:

• To create a multi-page e-learning website using front-end technologies 
• To design a simple and user-friendly interface for learners  
• To organize course-related content using layouts and cards  
• To embed a video tutorial within the website  
• To visually represent the student’s learning progress  
• To improve practical skills in HTML, CSS and JavaScript  
• To implement a responsive design that adapts to screen sizes  

# FEATURES IMPLEMENTED:

• Structured navigation bar on top of every page  

• Home page displaying welcome message and progress preview  

• Course listing page with six different technology courses 

• Course details page with embedded learning video and syllabus 

• Dashboard page containing progress bar and course completion section  

• JavaScript alert feature in dashboard to enhance interaction  

• Clean UI with card-based layout and Font Awesome icons  

• Footer section for page completeness and consistency  

# MODULES DEVELOPED:

Home Page:
Includes introduction, welcome text, student progress and quick buttons to navigate to other pages.

Courses Page:
Shows available courses with descriptions, levels and modules count. Allows the user to start learning a specific course.

Course Details Page:
Displays a video lesson embedded from YouTube along with a simple syllabus structure to guide learning.

Dashboard Page:
Shows overall learning progress with a visual progress bar and lists completed courses. Also includes an alert-based certificate access feature.

# TECHNOLOGIES USED:

HTML5 – To structure and build the webpage layout  
CSS3 – To add styling, spacing, alignments and responsiveness  
JavaScript – To create basic user interaction through alerts  
Font Awesome – To include icons that improve UI representation  
VS Code – To write and manage project files  
Live Server – To run and test the project during development  

# RESPONSIVENESS:

The website layout adapts properly to different screen sizes such as mobile, tablet and desktop. Content blocks like grids, cards and navigation rearrange to maintain readability and usability across various devices.

# LEARNING OUTCOMES:

Completing this project strengthened my practical knowledge in front-end development. I learned how to create multiple linked pages, design card layouts using Flexbox and Grid, embed videos within a webpage and implement JavaScript functions for user interaction. The project also helped me improve my creative UI skills and understand how real-world learning platforms display content in an organized manner.

# FUTURE ENHANCEMENTS:

• Add user login and authentication system  
• Store user progress in a database using backend integration  
• Include quizzes and tests for each course  
• Provide downloadable certificates after course completion  
• Upload more courses and multiple videos for each course  
• Include a dark mode for better accessibility
